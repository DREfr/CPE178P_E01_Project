# CPE178P_E01_Project

This project develops an automated, reliable system to support or replace manual rock classification by leveraging AI. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on an image dataset to classify rocks automatically. The system consists of a classification server backend for inference and a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for uploading and classifying rock images. It aims to assist geologists, engineers, students, and environmental scientists by providing accurate and consistent rock identification, reducing the subjectivity and time consumption of manual classification.
