# CPE178P_E01_Project

Installation and Setup
Install Python 3.x and required AI libraries (TensorFlow or PyTorch).

Setup backend inference server using FastAPI.

Deploy the frontend GUI for user interaction.

Prepare the rock image dataset for training and inference.

Configure persistent storage (database) for logs and metadata.

Usage
Upload a rock image in supported formats (e.g., JPG, PNG) via the GUI.

The classification server processes the image using the trained AI model.

View the predicted rock type and corresponding confidence score.

Access historical classification results and export logs if needed.

Administrators can update the AI model and monitor analytics through dedicated interfaces.

Project Structure
/backend - FastAPI server code and AI model integration.

/frontend - GUI user interface code.
